# Database Migration Guide - Production Railway Database

## üö® CRITICAL: Production Database Migration

This guide helps you safely run migrations on your **live Railway production database**.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

1. ‚úÖ Your backend is deployed and running on Railway
2. ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database service is added to your Railway project
3. ‚úÖ You need the Railway database credentials

---

## üîß Setup Production Migration Environment

### Step 1: Get Railway Database Credentials

1. Go to your **Railway project dashboard**
2. Click on your **PostgreSQL database service**
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Copy these values:
   - `PGHOST` (e.g., `roundhouse.proxy.rlwy.net`)
   - `PGPORT` (usually `5432`)
   - `PGUSER` (usually `postgres`)
   - `PGPASSWORD` (long random string)
   - `PGDATABASE` (usually `railway`)

### Step 2: Configure Migration Environment

1. Edit the `.env.migration` file in your project root:

```bash
# Production Migration Environment Variables
DATABASE_HOST=your-actual-railway-pg-host.proxy.rlwy.net
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-actual-railway-pg-password
DATABASE_NAME=railway
NODE_ENV=production
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Railway database credentials.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Migrations

### Check Current Migration Status
```powershell
npm run migration:show:prod
```
This shows which migrations have been applied and which are pending.

### Run Pending Migrations
```powershell
npm run migration:run:prod
```
This applies all pending migrations to your production database.

### Revert Last Migration (if needed)
```powershell
npm run migration:revert:prod
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **USE WITH CAUTION**: This reverts the last applied migration.

---

## üìù Current Migration

Your project has one migration: `AddRaisedToCauseAndDonations1680000000000`

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Adds `raised` column to `causes` table (decimal with default 0)
- ‚úÖ Creates `donations` table with proper foreign key relationships

**SQL Operations:**
```sql
-- Up migration
ALTER TABLE "causes" ADD "raised" decimal(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';
CREATE TABLE "donations" (
    "id" uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    "amount" decimal(12,2) NOT NULL,
    "donorName" varchar(255),
    "donorEmail" varchar(255),
    "causeId" uuid NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT "PK_donations_id" PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
    CONSTRAINT "FK_donations_cause" FOREIGN KEY ("causeId") REFERENCES "causes"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## üöÄ Automated Migration on Deploy

To run migrations automatically on each Railway deployment, update your `railway.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm run migration:run && npm run start:prod",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This runs migrations on every deploy. Make sure migrations are idempotent.

---

## üõü Safety Tips

1. **Backup First**: Railway automatically backs up your database, but consider manual backup for critical operations
2. **Test Locally**: Always test migrations on a copy of production data first
3. **Read-Only Check**: Ensure your app can handle brief database unavailability during migration
4. **Monitor**: Watch Railway logs during migration execution
5. **Rollback Plan**: Know how to revert changes if something goes wrong

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```
Error: password authentication failed for user "postgres"
```
**Solution**: Double-check your Railway database credentials in `.env.migration`

### Migration Already Applied
```
Error: Migration "AddRaisedToCauseAndDonations1680000000000" has already been applied
```
**Solution**: This is normal. The migration was already run successfully.

### SSL Issues
```
Error: self signed certificate
```
**Solution**: The data source is configured to handle Railway's SSL automatically.

## üìû Support

- **Railway Logs**: Check your Railway deployment logs for detailed error messages
- **Database Console**: Use Railway's database console for direct SQL access
- **Migration Status**: Always check `npm run migration:show:prod` before running migrations

---

**‚ö° Ready to Run Migration?**

1. ‚úÖ Update `.env.migration` with Railway credentials
2. ‚úÖ Run `npm run migration:show:prod` to check status
3. ‚úÖ Run `npm run migration:run:prod` to apply migrations
4. ‚úÖ Verify your application works correctly

Your production database will be updated safely! üöÄ
